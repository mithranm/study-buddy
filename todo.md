* [ ] Work on preventing dupes from entering the system (Filename can not be the same even with different extension).
  * [ ] For now just look for the same filename if that filename exists in the chromaDB then reject upload and let the user know.
* [ ] Ollama.pull currently does not work in main.py figure out how to use this function correctly.
* [ ] Unit testing search function to see what it the json is. look at /backend/tests/test_main.py line 144
