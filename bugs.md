# Backend

* [X] MiniLM loads for each document in uploads rather than once for all uploads.
* [X] ollama is not pulling and is trigger the exception block in initialization
* [ ] File upload validation fails to reject invalid file types, allowing them into uploads instead of returning HTTP 400.

# Frontend

* [ ] Invalid file types should not be allowed to be selected

# Testing

* [ ] test_integration.log doesn't contain debug level logs.
