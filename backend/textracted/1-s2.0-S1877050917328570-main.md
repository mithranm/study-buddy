technologies in Computing. Everyone is using cloud computing in  our day to day life in one form or another without 
realizing it, like Microsoft Of fice 365, Gmail and Dropbox etc.  There are many advantages of using cloud 
computing such as an ytime-anywhere accessibility, better geogra phic coverage with the fastest time, less investment

<li>Cloud Computing Model 
There are five major actors [1] in cloud computing based on the ir participation as shown in Fig. 1. Cloud 
consumer or cloud service consumer (CSC) is the one who gets th e service from a cloud provider and pays for the 
service as per the use. Cloud pr ovider or cloud service provide r (CSP) is the one who provides the cloud services to 
the CSC. Cloud auditor is the one who conducts an independent a ssessment of cloud servi ces, information system 
operations, performance and security of the cloud implementatio ns. Cloud broker is the one who interacts between 
CSP and CSC to make the business happen. Cloud carrier is the o ne who provides the connectivity and cloud 
services from CSP to CSC.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Fig. 1. Cloud Computing Actors<br />
NIST based cloud computing model consists of four cloud deploym ent models, three service delivery models and 
five essential characteristics. A  Cloud can be deployed as Priv ate, Public, Community and Hybrid clouds. 
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS ), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS ) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are the three 
service delivery models have beco me widely recognized and formalized. Rapid Elasticity, Measured Service, 
Resource Pooling, Broad Network  access and On-Demand Self Servi ce are the five essential characteristics of cloud 
computing [1, 2 &amp; 3]. Other researchers [4, 5 &amp; 6] says that mu lti-tenancy is also an important characteristic of 
cloud computing. The following table 1 shows that a cloud computing delivery model can provide nine services, namely Application, Data, Runtime, Middleware, Operating System , Virtualization, Server, Storage and Networking 
which are the components in the t raditional computing [7, 8, 4] .<br />
Table 1 clearly determines the roles of CSP (shown in boldface)  and CSC in the delivery models’ services. In 
IaaS, the CSP provides only the infrastructure like server, sto rage, networks and virtualization. The CSC is 
responsible for Application, dat a, runtime, middleware and oper ating systems. In PaaS, only the Application and 
Data are CSC’s responsibility and the rest of the services are provided by CSP. In SaaS, all the nine services are 
provided by CSP. The security i ssues are also subject to the cloud deployment models.<br />

<p>Public cloud is more prone to security issues compared to other  cloud models because it is open to all and it is 
using the ubiquitous internet as the connection medium. So, sec urity policies and procedures should be different 
from one deployment model to another. Generally, CSPs are respo nsible for the cloud infrastructure and CSCs are 
responsible for the data and other things they are stored in th e cloud. So, security becomes a shared responsibility 
between CSP and CSC. According to Amazon Web Services (AWS), se curity responsibility is shared by both CSP 
and CSC and they called it as Shared Security Responsible Model  [9]. There are many security issues or challenges 
in all the nine services provided by the cloud delivery models.  This paper focuses only the data security issues and 
provides solutions to the issues. 
3. Data Security Issues or Challenges 
In enterprise computing, data is stored within their organizati on and it is fully under the control of the enterprise 
[10]. In cloud computing, the data is stored outside the custom er’s place (in the CSP’s si de). So, cloud computing 
must employ additional security  measures apart from the traditi onal security checks to ensur e that data is safe and no 
data breaches due to s ecurity vulnerabilities. 
3.1.Data Security Basics 
According to [6], there are six stages in the life cycle of dat a: Create, Store, Use, Share, Archive and Destroy. 
Once the data is created, it can m ove freely between any stages . Data should be secured in all the stages of its life 
cycle from its creation to its destruction. The store and archi ve stages are also called as data-at-rest, the use stage is 
called as data-in-use, the sharing stage is called as data-in-t ransit and the destroy stage can be called as data-after-
delete. All these stages are self-explanatory. Generally, encry ption is one of the methods in the data-in-transmit 
stage to protect the data. One of the neglected issues is data- after-delete [11] and this is also called as data 
remanence. Data remanence is the residual physical representati on of the data that has been deleted [12]. After a 
storage media is deleted, there may be some physical characteri stics that allow the data to be reconstructed [12, 13]. 
Tracing the data path (data lineage) is important for auditing in cloud computing, especially  in the public cloud apart 
from the above stages [11].<br />
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability are the three impor tant properties of the data and it is popularly called 
as CIA triad. Authentication, a uthorization and nonrepudiation are another three important  properties associated 
with people who access the data  [14]. Confiden tiality refers to data privacy where the data belongs to CSC is not 
revealed to unauthorized parties on any occasion [15]. The Inte grity of data refers to the confidence that the data 
stored in the cloud is not fiddled by unauthorized parties. It is also applicable when the data is in transit. Availability 
of data refers to pledge that whenever the CSC needs data, the data should be available to them without any delay or 
deny. These three basic data security properties are tested a l ot in the pubic cloud deployment model. Authentication 
is the proof for a person to acce ss his or her own data. Author ization is the act of determining whether a person has 
the right to perform an activity on data like reading or writin g. Users must be authenticated before carrying out the  P . Ravi Kumar  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 125 (2018) 691–697 693 Ravi Kumar. P, Herbert Raj, P and Jelciana, P. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000–000

performing a job. The following fig. 2 shows the four major cat egories of data security issues in cloud computing. </p>
<p>Fig. 2. Types of Data Security Issues<br />
3.2.Security Challenges in the CIA Triad 
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) losses can ma ke a big impact in the business of the cloud 
computing because the data is the core component for any busine ss. Data integrity is the assurance given to the 
digital information is uncorru pted and only be accessed by thos e authorized users. Thus, integrity involves 
maintaining the accuracy, consistency and trustworthiness of da ta over its entire life cycle [16]. Maintaining CIA is 
easier in enterprise computing but in cloud computing it is mor e complicated because o f the multi-tenant 
architecture and the distributed n ature of the infrastructure. The following steps can be used to maintain a proper 
CIA in cloud computing:  Once the data are created, classify the data, identify the sens itive data, define policies,  and create access methods 
for different types of data. Al so, create policies for data arc hive and data destroy. 
 Store data with proper physical a nd logical security protection , including the backup and recovery plan. 
 Identify which type of data can be shared, whom and how it can be shared and define data sharing policies. In 
cloud computing, many such polic ies are collectively called as Service Level Agreements (SLA). 
 Create a corrective action plan in case data is corrupted or ha cked due to network or communication devices, 
security flaws while d ata is in transit. 
According to Aldossary and Allen, integrity should be checked n ot only at data, but also at the competition level 
[4]. Computation integrity refers to only the authorized applic ations are allowed to access the data and use it for 
computation. Any abnormality from normal computing should be av oided. An effective Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) can avoid loss of confidentiality and integrit y. Loss of availability can happen through loss of 
data and data inaccessibility. Clou d computing employs few tech niques like scalability and high availability at the 
architecture level. There are different methods and procedures are followed to improve dat a security related to the 
CIA triad at different stages of the data lifecycle. Some of th e important methods are listed below:     <br />
 Apply data encryption when the data is at rest and also when th e data is in transit. Apply strong encryption 
algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest S hamir Adleman (RSA) algorithms. Different 
types of encryption methods are described in [4, 17]. Amazon S3  uses one of the strongest encryption algorithms, 
256-bit AES [9]. 
 Encryption methods are generally to provide confidentiality against attacks from a cloud provider, but it cannot protect data against configuration errors and software bugs [4] . Hash methods can be used  to find out accidental 
and intentional data changes. But they consume more bandwidth a nd time-consuming. 
 Third Party Auditing (TPA) can be employed to check for the dat a integrity. Many research ers [4, 18, 19] insists 
to audit data integrity by third-party au ditors because they ar e specialized in that. 
 Provable Data Possession (PDP) scheme was initiated by Ateniese  et al. to investigate statistically the correctness 
of the data without retrieving the data outsourced to cloud sto rage [20]. PDP limitations were overcome by 
Ateniese et al. themselves at [21, 22], Wang et al. at [23] and  Sookhak et al. at [24]. 
 Do not store the encryption keys along with the encrypted data [25]. 
 Implement proper Identity and A ccess Management (IAM) technique s for users to access data. Data Security Issues

 Use data duplication, redundancy,  backups and resilient systems  to address availability issues [25]. 
 Also, include a failover strategy in case the service fails wit h the CSP. 
 The data dispersion technique can be used to address the availa bility issue if other methods are not effective. 
Here the data is stored as fragments in many clouds and the dat a can be reconstructed when it is required to use 
fragmentation techniques [6]. 
3.3.Security Challenges in the Authen tication and Access Control (AAC) 
Authentication and Access Control (AAC) is the process of verif ication and confirmation on user’s identity to 
connect, to access and use the cloud resources. In enterprise c omputing, the credentials are stored in the server in the 
form of Active Directory (AD) or Lightweight Directory Access P rotocol (LDAP). In a private cloud, the 
authentication is done same as the enterprise computing via a v irtual private network. In public cloud, customers use 
the internet to connect to CSP,  applications from different use rs can co-exist with the same CSP (resource pooling) 
and CSC can access the applications from anywhere through any d evices. So the authentication in public cloud is 
more subject to vulnerability than private cloud [6]. A Passwor d-based authentication does not provide effective 
security for the public cloud. Passwords can be cracked using m any methods such as a brute force attack, dictionary 
attack, phishing or social engin eering attack. So it is very im portant that the CSP should include highly secured 
authentication methods in a public cloud. In cloud computing, c ustomers connect to cloud services through APIs and 
these API’s are designed to accept tokens rather than passwords  [6]. 
In cloud computing, authentication applies to not only users bu t also to machines. Machines need to authorize 
certain automated actions like online backup, patching and upda ting systems and remote monitoring systems [26]. 
Since the cloud applications are  accessed through various devic es, there should be a strong authentication method 
like RSA token, OTP over the phone, smart card / PKI, biometric s, etc., for the original identity confirmation and 
determine the type of credentials [6]. This will enable identif iers and attributes with a strong level of authentication 
to be passed on to the cloud application and the risk decisions  can be made for access management. There are a 
number of methods and standards available to avoid security iss ues related to AAC. The following are some of the 
important methods to mitigate AAC security challenges:  Apply single-sign-on policy where ever possible.</p>
<p> Multi-factor authentication can be employed which enables both identity and access management and it is used 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) [9].<br />
 Biometric authentication has the potential to be the most secur e form of single-sign-on authentication [27].<br />
 RSA cryptosystem can be adopted which can accept different auth entication models like two-factor 
authentication, knowledge-based a uthentication and adaptive aut hentication. The above methods are very 
effective for data protectio n in cloud computing [28].<br />
 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) , firewalls as well as segregat ion of obligations can be implemented on the 
different network and cloud laye rs to enable proper access cont rol in cloud computing for better data protection 
[28]. 
 There are many third-party identity management solutions in the  market. Employ some third-party solutions like 
Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Okta identity management, McAfee cloud identity manager, etc. Recently, Identity-Management-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solutions are getting more popular in the corporate infrastructure 
[29].</p>
<p> Cloud applications should use open standards where applicable, such as Security Assertion Markup Language 
(SAML), an XML-based OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of  Structured Information Standards) open 
standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data b etween security domains and Open Authorization 
(OAuth), an open standard for authorization, allowing users to share their private resources using tokens rather 
than credentials [6].<br />
3.4.Security Challenges Due to Broken Auth entication, Session an d Access Controls 
Broken authentication and session control threat occurs due to incorrect implementation of authentication and 
session management in the application domain. Examples of this type of threats are user credentials can be guessed 
due to weak account management functions, user credentials are not properly protected, session IDs are exposed in  P . Ravi Kumar  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 125 (2018) 691–697 695 Ravi Kumar. P, Herbert Raj, P and Jelciana, P. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000–000 
activity they are authorized to do. Nonrepudiation is the assur ance that an authenticated  user cannot deny after 
performing a job. The following fig. 2 shows the four major cat egories of data security issues in cloud computing. </p>

more subject to vulnerability than private cloud [6]. A Passwor d-based authentication does not provide effective 
security for the public cloud. Passwords can be cracked using m any methods such as a brute force attack, dictionary 
attack, phishing or social engin eering attack. So it is very im portant that the CSP should include highly secured 
authentication methods in a public cloud. In cloud computing, c ustomers connect to cloud services through APIs and 
these API’s are designed to accept tokens rather than passwords  [6]. 
In cloud computing, authentication applies to not only users bu t also to machines. Machines need to authorize 
certain automated actions like online backup, patching and upda ting systems and remote monitoring systems [26]. 
Since the cloud applications are  accessed through various devic es, there should be a strong authentication method 
like RSA token, OTP over the phone, smart card / PKI, biometric s, etc., for the original identity confirmation and 
determine the type of credentials [6]. This will enable identif iers and attributes with a strong level of authentication 
to be passed on to the cloud application and the risk decisions  can be made for access management. There are a 
number of methods and standards available to avoid security iss ues related to AAC. The following are some of the 
important methods to mitigate AAC security challenges: 
 Apply single-sign-on policy where ever possible.<br />
 Multi-factor authentication can be employed which enables both identity and access management and it is used 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) [9].<br />
 Biometric authentication has the potential to be the most secur e form of single-sign-on authentication [27].<br />
 RSA cryptosystem can be adopted which can accept different auth entication models like two-factor 
authentication, knowledge-based a uthentication and adaptive aut hentication. The above methods are very 
effective for data protectio n in cloud computing [28].<br />
 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) , firewalls as well as segregat ion of obligations can be implemented on the 
different network and cloud laye rs to enable proper access cont rol in cloud computing for better data protection 
[28]. 
 There are many third-party identity management solutions in the  market. Employ some third-party solutions like 
Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Okta identity management, McAfee cloud identity manager, etc. Recently, Identity-Management-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solutions are getting more popular in the corporate infrastructure 
[29].</p>
<p> Cloud applications should use open standards where applicable, such as Security Assertion Markup Language 
(SAML), an XML-based OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of  Structured Information Standards) open 
standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data b etween security domains and Open Authorization 
(OAuth), an open standard for authorization, allowing users to share their private resources using tokens rather 
than credentials [6].<br />
3.4.Security Challenges Due to Broken Auth entication, Session an d Access Controls 
Broken authentication and session control threat occurs due to incorrect implementation of authentication and 
session management in the application domain. Examples of this type of threats are user credentials can be guessed 
due to weak account management functions, user credentials are not properly protected, session IDs are exposed in 696 P . Ravi Kumar  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 125 (2018) 691–697
 Ravi Kumar. P, Herbert Raj, P and Jelciana, P. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000–000 
the URL, etc. Attacker takes advantage of the situation and can  compromise passwords, keys, session tokens or to 
exploit other implementation flaws to assume another user’s ide ntity [30]. Attackers generally target the privileged 
accounts. The Broken access contro l threat occurs when there is  a lack of enforcement of restriction on what 
authenticated users are allowed to do. Using this loophole, att ackers can access another user’s account, view 
sensitive files, modify another user’s data, change access righ ts etc. [30]. The following are some of the methods 
that can be used to re duce these challenges: 
 Implement a single set of stron g authentication and session man agement controls. 
 Avoid Cross-site Scripting (XSS) flaws which can be used to ste al session IDs. 
 Check Access – Each use of a direct reference from an untrusted  source must be checked for access control to 
ensure that the user is authoriz ed for the requested resource. 
 Use per user or session indirect object references – In this, t he coding pattern prevents attackers from directly 
targeting unauthorized resource. 
 Automated verification – Apply automation to verify proper auth entication deployment.  </p>
<p>3.5.Other Data Related Security Issues 
Other minor data related security issues can occur through Data  location, Multi-tenancy and Backup in cloud 
computing. In cloud computing, data is stored in a diverse geog raphic location with different legal jurisdictions [6]. 
If the data location is not safe physically and logically then there is always a threat to the CSC’s data. In that 
scenario, data is vulnerable to malicious insiders and external hackers. Due to the multi-tenant nature of the cloud 
computing, multiple users can store their data in the same loca tion using physical or virtual storage concept. 
Because of this scenario , a user can intrude  into another user’ s data location [10]. 
In cloud computing, all data, especially the sensitive data should be regularly backed up and tested for proper 
data recovery in case of disaste rs. A Backup is a form of data- at-rest. Strong encryption schemes can be used to 
protect backup data, especially if the data is sensitive [4]. T here are two types of backup, on-site backup and cloud-
based backup. Based on the cost, type of business and data, bac kup plan can be selected. On-site backup is cheaper, 
easier to set up and runs faster. The backup and the production  environments are the same and if any natural 
disasters, then all the data inc luding the backup are lost. In the cloud-based backup, CSC’s data is stored off-site and 
if any natural disasters on the CSC’s site, then the data is st ill available with the cloud. The following are some of 
the methods to overcome other data related security issues: 
 CSC should know the logical and the physical location of the da ta if not at least which state, country and data 
center due to all the potential regulatory, contractual and oth er jurisdictional issues [6]. 
 Establish location and jurisdic tional policies to govern the da ta location [6]. 
 Adopt intelligent data segregati on techniques to segregate the data from different users.<br />
 Use strong encryption techniques for the backup data to avoid d ata leakage.<br />
4. Conclusion and Future Challenges 
The cloud problems are mainly with the security and privacy of the data stored in the cloud. The cloud 
environments like heterogeneity, resource sharing, multi-tenanc y, virtualization, mobile cloud computing and 
Service Level Agreement (SLA) that makes the cloud security mor e vulnerable. This paper provides the data 
security issues and methods to overcome these issues. There are  also new developments in cloud computing like 
Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), So ftware-defined networking (a c oncept to design and manage networks that 
abstracts applications away from the underlying networks), Soft ware-defined-storage (abstracts the logical storage 
services and capabilities away from the underlying hardware) an d Cloud-of-Things (CoT), (a concept combining 
cloud computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart city app lications). All these new developments bring new 
challenges in cloud computing and they need to be addressed. Wh en there is a change in technology, always review 
the security policies and proced ures and update accordingly to protect the data and its privacy.<br />
