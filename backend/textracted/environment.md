<p>What Is Climate Change?
1. Climate change  can be a natural process where temperature, rainfall, wind and 
other elements vary over decades or more. In millions of years, our world has been 
warmer and colder than it is now. But today we are experiencing rapid warming from 
human activities, primarily due to burning fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gas 
emissions.
2. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions  from human activity act like a blanket 
wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
3. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include 
carbon dioxide and methane. These come from burning fossil fuels such as gasoline 
for driving a car or coal for heating a building. Clearing land and forests can also 
release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are another source. Energy, industry, 
agriculture and waste disposal are among the major emitters.
4. Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million years  and 
continue to rise. As a result, the earth is about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 1800s. 
The last decade was the warmest on record. 
5. Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But 
temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, 
where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all 
others. The consequences of climate change  now include, among others, intense 
droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, 
catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
6. People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways. It affects our health, 
ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable 
to climate impacts, such as people living in small island developing States. Conditions 
like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole 
communities have had to relocate. In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is 
expected to rise.
7. Every increase in global warming matters.  In a 2018 report, thousands of scientists 
and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more 
than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable 
climate. Yet the current path of carbon dioxide emissions could increase global 
temperature by as much as 4.4°C by the end of the century .

8. The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and 
affect everyone, but some countries produce much more  than others. The 100 least-
emitting countries generate 3 per cent of total emissions. The 10 largest emitters 
contribute 68 per cent. Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries 
creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first. <br />
9. Climate change is a huge challenge, but we already know many solutions. These can 
deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We 
also have global agreements to guide progress, such as the UN Framework Convention 
on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement . Three broad categories of action are: cut 
emissions, adapt to climate impacts and finance required adjustments.
10. Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar will reduce 
the emissions driving climate change. But we have to start right now. While a growing 
coalition of countries is committing to net zero emissions  by 2050, about half of 
emissions cuts must be in place by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel 
production must decline by roughly 6 per cent per year between 2020 and 2030. 
11. Adapting to climate consequences  protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, 
infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the 
future. Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most 
vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of 
return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and 
property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost. 
12. We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future. Climate action requires 
significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction 
is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their 
commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt 
and move towards greener economies.
